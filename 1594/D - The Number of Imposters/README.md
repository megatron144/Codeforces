However, he always plays with Cypriot players, and they all have the same name: "Andreas" (the most common name in Cyprus).</p><p>In each game, Theofanis plays with $$$n$$$ other players. Since they all have the same name, they are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.</p><p>The players write $$$m$$$ comments in the chat. A comment has the structure of "$$$i$$$ $$$j$$$ $$$c$$$" where $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$ are two distinct integers and $$$c$$$ is a string ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$; $$$i \neq j$$$; $$$c$$$ is either <span class="tex-font-style-tt">imposter</span> or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">crewmate</span>). The comment means that player $$$i$$$ said that player $$$j$$$ has the role $$$c$$$.</p><p>An imposter always lies, and a crewmate always tells the truth. </p><p>Help Theofanis find the maximum possible number of imposters among all the other Cypriot players, or determine that the comments contradict each other (see the notes for further explanation).</p><p>Note that each player has exactly <span class="tex-font-style-bf">one</span> role: either <span class="tex-font-style-tt">imposter</span> or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">crewmate</span>.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

But if player $$$2$$$ is an imposter then he must be lying, so player $$$1$$$ can't be a crewmate. Contradiction.</p></div>
